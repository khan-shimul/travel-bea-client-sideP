Here is my live project [TravelBea](https://travel-bea.web.app/).

## About this project:

TravelBea is a Travel AGency related website. Here user can book ticket to travel.

* This is react.js website. I used used React-bootstrap, React font-awesome, React Router, React Rating nd Vanilla CSS.
* Also i used mongodb database.
* User can check their bookings.
* And also implement Admin Dashboard.
* Admin can manage all orders.
* Implement Authentication system.
* Implement private route/protected route
* Implement Redirect uri (user friendly)

I have to improve my design and work on Admin Dashboard. However, i'll add more feature in the future.
